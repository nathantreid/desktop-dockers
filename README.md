Desktop in a box with libreoffice, hits CPU fairly hard.
Output folder is /home/ubuntu/unraid. user/password is ubuntu:PASSWD (case sensitive).
Once you have logged in and as long as you don't logout again you can resume a session by selecting it from the login dropdown.
There are some wallpapers in /home/ubuntu/unraid/wallpapers.
